        The game is centered around remembering an increasing number of rules for block placement.
        Blocks will fall from the top of the screen. The left button will shift the block to the left and the right button will shift the block to the right.
        Follow the rules to fill up the screen. Be careful! If a rule is broken, you will lose some of your progress.
