**T**ile is a version of concentration which allows users to upload their own pictures into the tiles.
**Σ** (Summation) is a combination of all skills in a fun, logical, and simplistic quiz format.
**M**usic is a rhythm game with five songs of varying genres, in which players tap notes to the melody of the song.

This app was the BBHS Computer Club's submission to the 2017 Westchester Mobile App Bowl, earning first place in usability.

Two separate versions of this app exist: the main (android) version, in the master branch, and the iOS version, in the master-ios branch.
